Predicting movie ratings based on movie metadata from online movie resources like IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes and Open Movie db.

Feature Identification:
This task  involves identifying features of movies, actors and directors that directly correlate with the movie score,
Which is handled by the Java feature generator.

Model Building:
Dimensionality reduction and regularization techniques are used to weight features from the feature set to improve the models performance and highly impact the rating of the movie,
this is achieved using linear regression with regularizing the attributes. 

Used Python's SCIPY machine learning library to implement the regression models.
